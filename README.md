## **Idea**

#### When I first started this project, the first thing I needed was an idea of what to create. While trying to figure out what I was going to make, I realized a web page is a great option because web development interested me the most and was fun to play with. Another reason is that I enjoy designing things and am somewhat of a perfectionist on certain aspects. So, I thought, "this is a great idea."

## **What the Website is About**

#### After choosing to make a website, I needed to decide its topic. The first thing that came to mind was a Fitness Tracking Website, complete with a registration and login system, a page to input training days and view progress charts, and an exercise database (sourced from somewhere) with a wide variety of options (including sets and reps). However, after spending around 10+ hours on the website, I realized that I had only implemented buttons that redirected to different pages (register, login, profile, about, exercise database, etc.) and the CSS designs for it. Seeing this, I decided to change the website idea to a portfolio website with minimal features and functions, so I could focus on designing the front-end, adding effects, and diving into the CSS and HTML YouTube rabbit hole.

## **Creating the Portfolio Website**

#### Four days had passed since watching the final lecture, and one day after starting over, I finally decided to work on the project after watching CSS and HTML tutorial videos and reading the w3schools documentation. I opened my code editor, saw a blank page, and excitedly started coding. After a few hours, I looked back at my code and thought, "it's so unorganized and messy." I hesitantly decided to reorganize my code, knowing that I would inevitably spend a couple of hours on it, as I don't like to stop a task I enjoy until it's perfect.

#### After spending two days "reorganizing" it, I spent no more than 11+ hours on it and made a few changes, including switching to a new code editor and using a whole new framework, trying to use React for JavaScript. I watched a couple more YouTube videos with stunning portfolio examples made by front-end professionals. Finally, I finished it, or so I thought.

## **The Second Redo**

#### Finishing the website felt great, but I realized I didn't like the design of the buttons and thought, "this surely wouldn't take long to fix." Little did I know how wrong I was about that.

## **The Third and Final Redo**

#### Eight hours passed since making a "small change to the buttons," and I was still unsatisfied with the design. So, I decided to start from scratch again.

#### Feeling a bit tired of redoing it, I went back to the vscode cs50 IDE codespace to work on it since it's so easy to use, and I have over 3 months of experience with it. Safe to say, I was way better and more comfortable with it compared to other code editors.

#### There I was warmly greeted with a blank untitled page to work with again. With high motivation and confidence that this was it, this will be my final redo, I worked on it tirelessly for hours at a time, completely absorbed in the process and enjoying every part of it.

#### After some time, I was 90% done with the project and decided to go to sleep and finish it all the next day.

## **Finishing it All**

#### After waking up and making my morning coffee, I ran the last bit of the marathon to complete the project.

#### And as night approached, I finished my project, barely able to hide my smile after completing it.

#### And with that, I have finished the project and am currently working on the README.md description as I'm typing this.

## *Final Say*

#### - This course was unbelievably amazing; it can't be described in my words. It helped me a lot in understanding the basic concepts of computer science and will aid me in learning more computer science concepts in the future.

#### - My name is Muhammad Al Fatih, and this was my CS50 final project submission.
